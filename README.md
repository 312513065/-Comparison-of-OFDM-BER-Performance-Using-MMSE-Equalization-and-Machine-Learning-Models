## üñê System Model

We estimate the wireless channel **h** using OFDM pilot signals **x**, with the received signal **y**:

$$
y = h \cdot x + n
$$

Where:
- `x`: known OFDM symbol after 64-point IFFT, consisting of 16-QAM modulated data and 9 pilot subcarriers
- `y`: received signal at the receiver, after passing through the 3-tap multipath channel and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
- `h`: channel impulse response, shape (3,), a complex-valued 3-tap channel 
- `n`: additive white Gaussian noise

### Signal Generation:
- 16-QAM modulation generates baseband symbols.
- Symbols are mapped onto 64 OFDM subcarriers, with 9 designated as pilot subcarriers.
- A 64-point IFFT converts to time domain.
- A cyclic prefix is added before transmission.

### üß™ Channel Data & Augmentations
- The signal passes through a 3-tap channel **h** (frequency-selective fading).
- Additive white Gaussian noise **n** is added at the receiver, with SNR randomly chosen between 5 dB and 25 dB.
- The received signal **y** is processed by MMSE or machine learning-based equalization (CNN / LSTM / Transformer)

## üß† Models Implemented

| Model             | Description                                                                                     | Parameter Count      |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **SimpleCSINet3D**       | 3D CNN that processes input as a volume across (Rx, Tx, pilots). Fast and effective for spatial features. | üèÜ **18,490**          |
| **LSTMCSINet**           | Treats pilots as sequential input. Captures frequency correlation. Best when channel response has structure across L. | 235,552               |
| **TransformerCSINet**    | Uses self-attention across pilot subcarriers. Learns global relationships among antennas and subcarriers. | 537,760               |

**Input Format**: Each model receives input of shape `(batch, 4, N_rx, N_tx, L)`,  
where the 4 channels represent `[x_real, x_imag, y_real, y_imag]`.  
Real and imaginary parts of pilot and received signals are stacked along the channel dimension.

**Output Format**: The model outputs a predicted channel tensor \( \hat{H} \) of shape `(batch, N_rx, N_tx, L, 2)`,  
where the last dimension contains the real and imaginary components of the estimated channel matrix.

**Conclusion**: Among all models, the 3D CNN has the lowest parameter count (18K) while achieving the best trade-off between accuracy and latency.  
This lightweight nature makes it ideal for real-time CSI estimation and hardware deployment, especially under edge-device constraints.
### Input:

All models take 

input:
<pre> x_input: (batch, 64, 5) # 4 channels = [ y_real, y_imag, pilot_mask, pilot_real_value  , pilot_img_value ]  </pre> 

output:
<pre> y_output: (batch, 55, 2) # 2 channels = [ symbol_real, symbol_imag ]  </pre>




## üìä Results & Visualizations

Below we present training results on both **Rayleigh** and **DeepMIMO** datasets for each model. We include:

- **Loss Curves**: Training vs. validation MSE loss across epochs. The dotted line indicates MMSE baseline.  
- **Heatmaps**: Visual comparison of true vs. predicted channel magnitudes for a selected sample.  
- **Residual Histograms**: Distribution of element-wise difference between predicted and true channels.
